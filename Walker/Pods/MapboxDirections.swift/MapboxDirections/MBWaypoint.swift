    /**
     The direction from which a route must approach this waypoint in order to be considered viable.
     
     This property is measured in degrees clockwise from true north. A value of 0 degrees means due north, 90 degrees means due east, 180 degrees means due south, and so on. If the value of this property is negative, a route is considered viable regardless of the direction from which it approaches this waypoint.
     
     If this waypoint is the first waypoint (the source waypoint), the route must start out by heading in the direction specified by this property. You should always set the `headingAccuracy` property in conjunction with this property. If the `headingAccuracy` property is set to a negative value, this property is ignored.
     
     For driving directions, this property can be useful for avoiding a route that begins by going in the direction opposite the current direction of travel. For example, if you know the user is moving eastwardly and the first waypoint is the user’s current location, specifying a heading of 90 degrees and a heading accuracy of 90 degrees for the first waypoint avoids a route that begins with a “head west” instruction.
     
     You should be certain that the user is in motion before specifying a heading and heading accuracy; otherwise, you may be unnecessarily filtering out the best route. For example, suppose the user is sitting in a car parked in a driveway, facing due north, with the garage in front and the street to the rear. In that case, specifying a heading of 0 degrees and a heading accuracy of 90 degrees may result in a route that begins on the back alley or, worse, no route at all. For this reason, it is recommended that you only specify a heading and heading accuracy when automatically recalculating directions due to the user deviating from the route.
     
     By default, the value of this property is a negative number, meaning that a route is considered viable regardless of the direction of approach.
     
     This property corresponds to the angles in the [`bearings`](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#retrieve-directions) query parameter in the Mapbox Directions API.

     A value of 0 degrees means that the approach must match the specified `heading` exactly – an unlikely scenario. A value of 180 degrees or more means that the approach may be as much as 180 degrees in either direction from the specified `heading`, effectively allowing a candidate route to approach the waypoint from any direction.
     
     If you set the `heading` property, you should set this property to a value such as 90 degrees, to avoid filtering out routes whose approaches differ only slightly from the specified `heading`. Otherwise, if the `heading` property is set to a negative value, this property is ignored.
